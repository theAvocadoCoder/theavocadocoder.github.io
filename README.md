## Overview

Welcome to my portfolio site! This website serves as a showcase of my work and a central hub where you can find information about me. Created using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, the site features an avocado-themed design inspired by my GitHub username, 'theavocadocoder.' It includes a light and dark mode toggle, fully mobile-responsive design, and sections covering my projects, about me, and how to contact me.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript**: The core technologies for building the portfolio.
- **pdf.js Library**: Utilized for rendering the PDF resume on the site.
- **Web3Forms**: Integrated for handling the contact form and sending messages to my email address.

## Design Considerations

- **Avocado Theme**: Inspired by the avocado theme, the light mode reflects a guacamole aesthetic, while the dark mode features dark greens and neon accents for a techy vibe.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured that the site is fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across various screen sizes.
